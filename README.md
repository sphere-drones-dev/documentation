## Introduction

Curo Wayline Planner is a straightforward wayline management platform that enables users to create new area and waypoint waylines, and ultimately export them as KMZ files. Users can subsequently import these waylines into other platforms like FlightHub 2 or FlytBase to execute flights with connected real devices. For more information, please visit to the following pages:
